I am a sophomore and Computer Science Major with a concentration in Economics at Harvey Mudd College. 
I am currently looking for an internship or research position in the field of Computer Science.

Throughout my CS journey, I have had experience in Python, C++, and Java. 
As a freshman, I created a BlackJack User vs AI simulator through Python object-oriented programming. 
Since then, I have participated in projects that involve Machine Learning, Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and API and JSON utilization. 
As a NBA fan, I developed a NBA betting model through linear regression by quantifying winning odds for the users; 
I used ML techniques to manipulate variables and test models that utilized statistics from the Basketball-Reference website. 
I am currently a research assistant in the study of tribology, and I develop ML models that quantify the displacement of gas-phase synthesized 
graphene particles in various oils and mediums. 
I am also a member of the MuddSub team - a group of forty STEM-focused students that makes autonomous underwater vehicles for the RoboSub competition; 
I combine computer vision, AI, and particle filter localization fundamentals to create a fully perceptual mechanism that can traverse through bodies 
of water and avoid obstacles in its path.

One of my strongest skills is my drive to support those in need. 
I was the lead volunteer at a Korean senior health clinic, Center for Better Life for four years. 
I have also traveled to Tijuana with my church for a week to give food, clothing, and prayers to hundreds of different families. 
I was the Business Manager for an online shop through Etsy; I sold affordable face masks and clothing for children and adults during 
the peak of the pandemic. I am a CS grader and tutor, and I teach incoming freshman Python fundamentals including recursion, circuits, 
data structures, and object-oriented programming. I guide students to explore CS topics that will potentially prompt them to become future 
computer scientists. I am also a member of the Gateway for Exploring Mathematical Sciences where I guide eighth, ninth, and tenth graders 
through workshops and puzzles that get them curious about solving complex, analytical math concepts.

I am looking for a group of innovative, creative, and inspiring talent that can provide real-world technical training opportunities for me. 
I wish to join a team that can propel me to accomplishing my dream: to combine my passion for computer science and helping others to make a positive, 
lasting change in my community.
