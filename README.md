I am a sophomore and Computer Science Major with a concentration in Economics at Harvey Mudd College. Throughout my CS journey, I have had experience in Python, C++, and Java. I wish to utilize my computational intelligence and abilities to change the world for the better.

I am currently looking for an internship or research position in the field of Computer Science. I am looking for a group of innovative, creative, and inspiring talent that can provide real-world technical training opportunities for me. I wish to join a team that can propel me to accomplishing my dream: to combine my passion for computer science and supporting others in need to make a positive, lasting change in my community.
